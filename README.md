# Computer-Vision
This repository contains assignments of Computer vision that I had done in IIITH.

 TOPICS
  Assignment-1
The goal of the assignment is to familiarize you to the process of camera calibration and the critical role it plays in using any measurements of the world from images.

  Assignment-2
The goal of the assignment is to familiarize you to optical flow which is the most general and challenging version of motion estimation. It involves computing an independent estimate of motion at each pixel.

  Assignment-3
  The goal of the assignment is to familiarize you with the use of Markov Random Fields for Computer Vision. Specifically, in the use-case of image segmentation. Implmentation of “GrabCut” — Interactive Foreground Extraction using Iterated Graph Cuts for image segmentation
